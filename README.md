# *README*

# A. Overview

This will be a browser-based, text-based MMORPG where users interact with 
an in-browser text console to play the game. In the future, I will look into 
possibly adding the ability to easily play from the command line using bash.

# B. The Plan

The server backend of the game will be built using Go hosted on Heroku
with Google Cloud Firestore as a database. The frontend will be relatively
simple and will use basic HTML5 and CSS, though maybe I'll use a framework 
for it in the future (this project is mostly an exercise in backend 
Go development for now).

# C. Gameplay

The gameplay has not been hashed out an incredible amount yet. Stay tuned!
