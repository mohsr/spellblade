# *README*

# A. Overview

This will be a browser-based, text-based MMORPG where users interact with 
an in-browser text console to play the game. In the future, I will look into 
possibly adding the ability to easily play from the command line using bash.

# B. The Plan

The server backend of the game will be built using Node.js hosted on 
Heroku with MongoDB hosted by mLab as a database. The frontend will be 
relatively simple and will use basic HTML5 and CSS.

# C. Gameplay

The gameplay has not been hashed out an incredible amount yet. Stay tuned!
