# A. Overview

Spellblade is a browser-based, text-based MMORPG where users interact with 
an in-browser console to navigate an online world with their own 
customizable characters as they explore, complete quests, and interact 
with each other.

In the future, I will look into adding the ability to play the game from the 
command line.

# B. The Plan

The server backend of the game will be built using Go hosted on Heroku
with MongoDB hosted by mLab as a database. The frontend will be relatively
simple and will use basic HTML and CSS.

# C. Gameplay

The gameplay has not been hashed out an incredible amount yet. Stay tuned!
